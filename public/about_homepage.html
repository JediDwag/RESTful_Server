                        <h3>Vue</h3>
                        <p>
                            View.js is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
                            Extending HTML, Vue uses "components" as custom elements for templating and UI binding.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Promise</h3>
                        <p>
                            In JavaScript, Promise objects are placeholders for values not yet received, but will be gotten
                            at a later time. They are a guarentee that we'll eventually know the result of an asynchronous 
                            computation.
                        </p>
                        <h3>RESTful</h3>
                        <p>
                            REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. Using HTTP, web services that are based on REST 
                            architecture are known as RESTful. A REST server provides access to resources, and REST clients 
                            access and modifie resources through different requests.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Leaflet</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Leaflet API allows you to render interactive maps in your web page as well as overlay data 
                            on top of the map. The map can be modified either by user interaction or by JavaScript commands.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Nominatim</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Nominatim API allows you to search for locations by name, or retrieve a location's name based 
                            on latitude and longitude coordinates. Nominatim uses the OpenStreetMap dataset to index named or numbered 
                            features within it, as well as other unnamed sights, pubs, and hotels.
